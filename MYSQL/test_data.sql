        "<p>The first stop in our European calendar was the 76th Tour of Albania. The race consists of 5 stages, the first three of them are almost pan-flat so they would most likely be contested by sprinters. Then the race hit the mountains for a short but grueling climbing stage with 3000m of elevation before the last one which would see the peloton travel over hilly terrain providing opportunities for anybody who felt strong enough to attack.&nbsp;</p><p>Our team lined up with a new group of riders and after a hectic first stage, where we saw one of us crash hard on a downhill section (thankfully escaped only with scuffs), we were ready to be in the mix for the upcoming sprint finishes.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Day two and three</em> saw our guys fighting hard for the day&#39;s breakaway, and then assembled for the last fight when we nearly cracked top 10, a fact that made us both happy and eager to try harder the upcoming days.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, <em>day 4</em> wasn&#39;t meant to be a good one; a few mechanical problems along with the ferocious pace set by the Italian pro squads didn&#39;t leave us any chance to compete in the final part.</p><p><em>Day 5</em> and the fatigue had started to kick in-after all it was our first ever 5-day race and it takes some time to get used to such intensity day after day-the race was won by Albania&#39;s local hero and pro rider Eughert Zuppa, who survived almost 100kms alone in front of the pack which didn&#39;t look eager to chase as GC has already been decided.&nbsp;</p><p>Our guys finished safely with the bunch, proud of their performances and how they managed to mix it up with pro squads! One thing is for sure, <u>we will come back stronger and more prepared!</u></p>",

Although the race wasn&#39;t perfect for us, our young gun <strong>Dimitris Christakos</strong> managed to take 3rd in the U23 category so we couldn&#39;t ask for more!

This year&#39;s edition took place in two different countries, starting in Bosnia, with a circuit around the city of Sarajevo.&nbsp;</p><p>The next day we traveled back to Serbia, crossing the borders while racing through magnificent natural scenery. Unfortunately, we couldn&#39;t animate the race but at least tried our best, acquired valuable experience for the future, and promised ourselves to return stronger and better prepared.</p>",
