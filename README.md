# About

This repo hosts the blogging website for Alfa Cycling Team. This is by no means a complete blogging engine, or a pitch
perfect frontend. This project was developed while I was exploring the web front.

# Run

I use Jetbrains products so the scripts should be available in the run tab.

Clone the project:

    git clone git@github.com:xrazis/alfacycling.com.git

and then with docker-compose:

    docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.yml up –d –build

In a few moments the app will be up and running. Check `localhost:8080`.
